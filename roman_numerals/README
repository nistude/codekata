Start with the simplest implementation possible. Don't try to find a solution
all at once. This kata will help you create the muscle memory to start with the
most naive solution first. In fact, I'm recommending you write your tests in
this order (again, only write enough code to make each test pass):

given 0, should return empty list
given 1, should return empty list
given 2, should return 2
given 3, should return 3
given 4, should return 2,2
given 5, should return 5
given 6, should return 2,3
given 9, should return 3,3
given 9973, should return 9973
